        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> I had visited in dec 2018</h5>

        <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the
          entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on
          the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the
          servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring
          celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there
          is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.

        <p class="text-muted">It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to
          understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow
          painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices
          that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15
          for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting
          this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.

      or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man
      and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero
      movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment

      <p>I took my kids to watch the movie and they loved it. The story shows how a young lion prince, after the murder
        of his father, flees his kingdom only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery. This movie is
        worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and cinematography. The music was phenomenal. Beyoncé really brought Nala
        to live but the show stealers were Timon and Pumba. Kids would love it.</p>

        nationwide become more resilient.
        The Central Park Climate Lab team wants to use data from satellites and on the ground to study seasonal patterns
        and how plant and animal life respond to shifting weather.

        "We want to understand how the park is part of the solution," says Karen Seto, professor of geography and
        urbanisation science at the Yale School of the Environment.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A new study by researchers at Stockholm
        University, University of Oulu, and Greifswald University has investigated the potential impacts of climate
        change on butterflies. In laboratory experiments the researchers exposed the chrysalises of green-veined white
        butterflies -- which are common throughout the UK and Europe -- to simulated autumn conditions of varying
        temperature and length.
        The researchers found the chrysalises exposed to warmer and longer autumn conditions lost more weight and used
        more energy than those exposed to milder conditions. Although the butterflies didn't die immediately under the
        more elevated conditions, the researchers found that those that experienced them were less likely to survive to
        adulthood the following spring.
